# BACS 200 - Class Format

In the past BACS 200 has been conducted fully in person and fully online.
Each of these formats have strengths and weaknesses.  
This version of the class will provide the best of both.


## Maximum Flexibility

During the semester there will be daily readings scheduled in the Zybooks
interactive textbook.  This guide contains a detailed description of everything
you need to know to build web pages.  It also contains activities to track
your progress and improve engagement.
Completing the reading is essential to you learning and will account for 50% 
of your grade.

Recorded lectures will guide you through some additional information and
guide you through the projects that you will be constructing.  You can watch
these lectures any time and anywhere to give you maximum flexibility.


## Maximum Interaction

This course is built around a series of 14 projects that will introduce you to all
the aspects of web development.  Each week you will build a set of web pages
to match a specification.  These will become more complex throughout the 
semester.

You will be able to work on the project anywhere at any time.  But you are
also likely to have questions that are not easily answered on your own.  I will
be available to help you when you get stuck.

We have Kepner 0090 reserved for MWF 2:30-3:20. We will not be doing lectures
during the class time.  You will be able
to work in the room and use the lab computers that are there.  

On Wednesdays I
will be present in Kepner 0090 to help anyone that wants assistance on your project.
This is completely optional, but some students can benefit greatly from it. 
I will also
hold regular office hours in Kepner 0095C, MWF 1:30-2:30. 


## Hybrid Approach

By combining high quality content that you can consume on your own with the 
opportunity to get some personal guidance you have the best of both worlds.
This class is geared toward giving you skills that will let you succeed in
any business that you become a part of.

I think that this arrangement will give you the best learning experience possible.
I look forward to meeting with each of you and teaching the skills required
to build web pages using HTML and CSS.
