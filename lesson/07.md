## BUILD

### Browser Shortcuts
* Turn on Bookmarks Toolbar
* Create short cuts
    * Website
    * Github
    * Sensei
    * Canvas


### HTML Validator
* We need a way to check our HTML 
* [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
* Point to your page and it will check it
* Bookmark this page in your Toolbar


### Using the Validator
* Work only on the first error (nothing else matters)
* Don't ignore errors (fix them before moving on)
* Some things are not worth fixing so move on


### Run the Validator 
* Run it on all new pages you create
* Run it on existing pages and fix the errors
* Make it a game


### Three Input Methods
* Validate by URI - give the URL of the published page
* Validate by File Upload - give it a local file on your computer
* Validate by Direct Input - cut and paste from Brackets


### Try all the Input Methods
* Use the appropriate one for each situation
* Run the validator early and often
* Don't publish bad files


### Project 3
* Build a page with things that you find amusing.
* Publish as "bacs200/amuse.html"
* Make sure you have valid HTML
* Add a profile photo to your profile page at "bacs200/profile.html"
