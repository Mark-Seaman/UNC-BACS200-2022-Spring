## BUILD

### Project 6 - URL Game
* Solve URL type puzzles
* 10 Correct in a row
* Typically requires about 50 attempts


### Project 6 - Superhero Page
* Build a page "bacs200/Superhero"
* Table 5x5
* Images stored in "bacs200/images"


### Test Cases
* All testing should be done with specific test cases
* Each test case either passes or fails
* Examples:
    * There is a page at bacs200/index.html
    * It has a title of Student Profile
    * It contains an image
    * It contains a bullet list of projects
    * It contain 500 words of text


### Manual Testing
* A human visits each page and decides pass/fail for each test case
* This testing should be scripted
* Create a page to jump to each place on your website


### Automated Testing
* Software tools can visit pages
* Pages can be searched for specific content


### Project Page Tester
* [Project Tests](https://shrinking-world.com/student/test)
* See if you can pass all of the tests
* Eventually this will be required
* This code may still have a few problems so don't worry if you can't solve every test
